一.Multiple Indices
All multi indices API support the following url query string parameters:

1. ignore_unavailable
Controls whether to ignore if any specified indices are unavailable, this includes indices that don’t exist or closed indices. Either true or false can be specified.

2. allow_no_indices
Controls whether to fail if a wildcard indices expressions results into no concrete indices. Either true or false can be specified. For example if the wildcard expression foo* is specified and no indices are available that start with foo then depending on this setting the request will fail. This setting is also applicable when _all, * or no index has been specified. This settings also applies for aliases, in case an alias points to a closed index.

3. expand_wildcards
Controls to what kind of concrete indices wildcard indices expression expand to. If open is specified then the wildcard expression is expanded to only open indices and if closed is specified then the wildcard expression is expanded only to closed indices. Also both values (open,closed) can be specified to expand to all indices.

If none is specified then wildcard expansion will be disabled and if all is specified, wildcard expressions will expand to all indices (this is equivalent to specifying open,closed).
