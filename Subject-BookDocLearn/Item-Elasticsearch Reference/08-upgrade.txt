Disable shard allocation.

一.关闭
原因:
When you shut down a node, the allocation process waits for one minute before starting to replicate the shards on that node to other nodes in the cluster, causing a lot of wasted I/O. 


PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "none"
  }
}

{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "persistent": {
    "cluster": {
      "routing": {
        "allocation": {
          "enable": "none"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "transient": {}
}

二.刷新:提交正在进行的事务,完成数据的持续化
Elasticsearch tracks the indexing activity of each shard. Shards that have not received any indexing operations for 5 minutes are automatically marked as inactive. This presents an opportunity for Elasticsearch to reduce shard resources and also perform a special kind of flush, called synced flush. A synced flush performs a normal flush, then adds a generated unique marker (sync_id) to all shards.

POST _flush/synced

{
  "_shards": {
    "total": 12,
    "successful": 6,
    "failed": 0
  },
  ".kibana": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "customer": {
    "total": 10,
    "successful": 5,
    "failed": 0
  }
}

三.关闭节点,修改软件
四.启动节点
五.使分片生效

Once the node has joined the cluster, reenable shard allocation to start using the node:

PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "transient": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "all"
  }
}

六.Wait for the node to recover.

GET _cat/health

Shards that were not sync-flushed might take longer to recover. You can monitor the recovery status of individual shards by submitting a _cat/recovery request:

GET _cat/recovery
