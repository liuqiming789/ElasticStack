Optional: If you want to install X-Pack on a machine that doesn’t have internet access:

Manually download the X-Pack zip file: https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/packs/x-pack/x-pack-6.1.1.zip (sha512)

Note
The plugins for Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Logstash are included in the same zip file. If you have already downloaded this file to install X-Pack on one of those other products, you can reuse the same file.

Transfer the zip file to a temporary directory on the offline machine. (Do NOT put the file in the Elasticsearch plugins directory.)

specify the location of the X-Pack zip file that you downloaded to a temporary directory.

bin/elasticsearch-plugin install file:///path/to/file/x-pack-6.1.1.zip

or

bin/elasticsearch-plugin install x-pack

Generate node certificates. For example, you can use the certgen command line tool to generate a certificate authority and signed certificates for your nodes.
