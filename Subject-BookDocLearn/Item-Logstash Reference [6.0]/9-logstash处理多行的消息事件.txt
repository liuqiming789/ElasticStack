Managing Multiline Events

plugins-codecs-multiline
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-codecs-multiline.html#plugins-codecs-multiline

The original goal of this codec was to allow joining of multiline messages from files into a single event

 joining Java exception and stacktrace messages into a single event.


The pattern option specifies a regular expression. Lines that match the specified regular expression are considered either continuations of a previous line or the start of a new multiline event. You can use grok regular expression templates with this configuration option.

  stdin {
    codec => multiline {
